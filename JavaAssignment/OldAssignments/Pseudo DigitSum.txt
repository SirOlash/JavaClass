Stage 2:
Prompt user to enter a number from 0-1000
Save the collected digit as "Integer"
Calculate Integer%10
save the calculated value as "LastNumber"
Calculate integer/10 
save the calculated value as "FirstTwo"
if FirstTwo==0, display "LastNumber"
if FirstTwo!=0,
Calculate FirstTwo%10 
Save the calculated value as "MiddleNumber"
Calculate FirstTwo/10 
Save the calculated value as "FirstNumber"
if FirstNumber==0,
calculate MiddleNumber+LastNumber
save the calculated value as "SumOfTwo"
Display SumOfTwo
if FirstNumber!=0,
Calculate FirstNumber+MiddleNumber+LastNumber
Save the calculated value as "SumOfThree"
Display "SumOfThree"
