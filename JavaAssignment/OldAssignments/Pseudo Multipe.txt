Pseudo Multipe:
Stage 1: 
Collect two integers from the user
Calculate the cube of the first
calculate square of second 
Check if the first is a multiple of second

Stage 2: 
Prompt the user to enter the first integer
Save the collected value as "first"
Prompt the use to enter the second integer
Save the collected value as "second"
Calculate first*3 
Save the calculated value as "firsttrippled"
Calculate second*2 
Save the calculated value as "seconddoubled"
Calculate firsttrippled%seconddoubled
if answer=0 display firsttrippled is a multiple of seconddoubled
