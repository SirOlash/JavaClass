Stage 1 
Collect the Acceleration and take off speed of the airplane from the user 
Calculate the runway length 
Display result

Stage 2
Prompt the user to enter the acceleration of the airplane in meters/seconds squared
Save the collected value as "accelerate"
Prompt the user to enter the speed of the airplane in meters/seconds
Save the collected value as "speed"
calculate speed * speed 
save the calculated value as "speedSquared"
Calculate 2 * accelerate 
save the calculated value as "acceleration"
calculate speedSquared/acceleration 
save the calculated value as "length"
