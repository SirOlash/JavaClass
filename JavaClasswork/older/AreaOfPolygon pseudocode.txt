Display result

Stage 2
Prompt the user to enter the number of sides on the polygon 
Save the collected value as "numberOfSides" 
Prompt the user to enter the length of a side 
Save the collected value as "length"
calculate length * length
Save the calculated value as "lengthSquared"
calculate (numberOfSides * lengthSquared) / (4 * tan (3.14/numberOfSides))
save the calculated result as "area"
